800x600 default screen size (preferably with adjustable screensize and borderless windowed option)
HUD that shows
-FPS
-level
-a useful hint for said level
-in game timer
typical platforming physics with:
-walking (with cycling animation frames)
-running (with cycling animation frames)
-dashing that keeps vertical speed through it
-jumping with varying height based on how long the button is pressed (like in mario, hollow knight, celeste, ect)
-slidy (not a set speed, kinda like if the entire game was on ice)
framerate independent
progress is made by going left
powerups:
-permanent dash length/speed increase
-permanent sprint speed increase
rebindable, saveable, and loadable controls with a GUI
progress saving:
-powerups
-which level the player is on
-a reset button
levels:
-a few tutorial stages (to teach controls and mechanics)
-MORE LEVELS (until i get bored of making them) (probably about 20-50)
an end screen for when the player completes the final level
levels would consist of:
-thin platforms that can be jumped on
-thick walls that can be jumped on, but cannot be walked through
-spikes that put the player back to the beginning of the level
procedural generation
level editor

possibly add sidescrolling?
possibly an ending cutscene?
